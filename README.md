# Usage

This repository is intended for instructors to collaborate and develop curriculum resources. Access should be limited to WCCI instructors. To actually use these documents, manually copy them into new repositories for each cohort.

# Grading

Homework assignments are self-graded by students the day they are due. They assign themselves a grade of 1 (Incomplete), 2 (Not Yet), 3 (Meets Requirements), or 4 (Outstanding). These map to 0%, 70%, 85%, and 100% respectively.

Each homework assignment is worth 5 points toward the overall cumulative grade.

Projects are graded by staff. Each project has a breakdown of tasks, each of which counts toward the overall total of points for the project. Each task is considered Incomplete, Not Yet, or Complete, worth 0%, 60%, or 100% respectively.

The tasks are scaled to count for 90 total points of a project. Additionally, Overall Code Quality is judged subjectively and counts for 10 points of a project, for each project being worth a total of 100 points.

Final projects are worth 100 points per week of the project. If the timing causes final projects to take 3 weeks, they will be worth 300 points total. These are graded based upon teams' abilities to meet milestones, factoring in contributions TBD.
