For tonight’s homework we will attempting to replicate the design of a website.
Surf the internet and look at some of your favorite websites. 
Once you have identified your favorite, break down the design elements and plan how you could replicate that design. 
Next, using Bootstrap in Visual Studio, attempt to replicate that site’s design to the best of your ability.
Submit the website when you are satisfied with your work. Good luck!
##Hints
- This exercise is to see how close you can get. You are not exepcted to match the website 100%
- Feel free to use placeholder images, placeholder text, or whatever elements are easiest for you to use.
